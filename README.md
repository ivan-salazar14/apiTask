# apiTask
API Rest where an Admin can ​ create ​ , ​ read ​ , ​ update ​ and ​ delete users and tasks (CRUD). The users created should have tasks assigned to them by the Admin and each user can ​ read ​ and ​ update ​ their own tasks (with authentication method). The Admin is the only one that can create tasks. There should be a login portal and all of the data created should be saved.
